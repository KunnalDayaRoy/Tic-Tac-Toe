# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game in which players take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. The game can also end in a draw if all of the spaces on the grid are filled without a winner. It is a simple game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
